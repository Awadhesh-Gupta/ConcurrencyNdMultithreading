# Concurrency and Multithreading in Java

This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate concepts of **Concurrency** and **Multithreading**, including inter-thread communication, synchronization, and common producer-consumer scenarios.

## 🔍 Descriptions

### 1. `ProducerConsumerPrblm_ImplmtngBlockingQueue.java`
A custom implementation of a **Blocking Queue** to solve the classic **Producer-Consumer problem** using:

- `synchronized` blocks
- `wait()` and `notifyAll()` for inter-thread communication
- Bounded queue behavior using a `LinkedList` with capacity limits

This file creates two threads:
- **Producer (Thread1)** adds integers to the queue.
- **Consumer (Thread2)** removes integers from the queue.

### 2. `ThreadSleepInLoop.java`
Demonstrates use of `Thread.sleep()` in a `for` loop to simulate thread execution delay and observe behavior over time.

## ✅ Concepts Demonstrated

- Java Thread Lifecycle
- Synchronization with intrinsic locks
- Inter-thread signaling using `wait()` and `notifyAll()`
- Queue operations in concurrent context
- Thread-safe design using intrinsic object monitor

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Awadhesh-Gupta/ConcurrencyNdMultithreading.git
   cd ConcurrencyNdMultithreading
````

2. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   javac src/multithreadingClass/*.java
   ```

3. Run the main class:

   ```bash
   java -cp src multithreadingClass.ProducerConsumerPrblm_ImplmtngBlockingQueue
   ```

## 📌 Requirements

* Java 8 or higher
* Basic understanding of threads and synchronization
